# Inspirations

This is a page of people that had inspired me. In the picture, it shows two professional League of Legends players that I looked up to when I first started playing the game and have just retired this year from pro-play. Also includes my current favorite artists, thanks to Spotify it told me who I listened to the most! Finally it has classes of animals and my favorite animal from each class!
